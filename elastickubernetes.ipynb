    "## Elasticsearch when you need it\n",
    "Elasticsearch is a powerful tool for searching through and aggregating over disjoint, unstructured data.  We find it especially useful in exploring large data sets.  Its flexibility and variety of aggregations help us to quickly identify interesting patterns that we may like to investigate further.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a search server, Elasticsearch's power lies in its distributed nature.  Horizontal scaling allows us to perform complex searches and aggregations over millions of documents in a few seconds.  This comes at a cost, though - of the real, financial variety. Running a large Elasticsearch cluster on a PaaS can incur significant expenses, as you are essentially renting computing power. \n",
    "\n",
    "You don't want to pay for machines when they are not in use. For example, if you are using Elasticsearch during regular work days, you would ideally not want to incur the costs of machines sitting there idly in between.  We have found, fortunately, that we can save significant amounts of money by taking advantage of Docker technology managed by Kubernetes in Google Cloud.  If you haven't heard of, or tried, Kubernetes, check it out!  We recently made the switch from Tutum, and we're a lot happier now.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that deploying a Dockerized Elasticsearch cluster in Kubernetes is actually pretty easy.  Additionally, bringing up the cluster and tearing it down when it is not in use can be done with a couple of scripts.  Leveraging Elasticsearch 2.3's backup and restore features, we can save our data to an HDFS storage solution and restore it upon creation of the cluster.  This post will discuss creating a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud, deploying our Dockerized Elasticsearch cluster within Kubernetes, and backing up and restoring from Google Storage's HDFS service."
